# [WORK IN PROGRESS]
A Pokédex app made with love, React and PokeAPI <3
Mainly for fun, testing and teaching purposes :)

It's still a work in progress and I there is a lot of stuff I want to do with this app, like add support for Service Workers and other cool technologies and app development techniques

### How to run it
1. Clone this repo
2. Then:
```js
npm install

npm run dev // to run the server on development mode
npm run start // to run the server on production mode

```
3. Go to http://localhost:3000
4. If you are running the dev server, you just have to wait until webpack has finished the bundling of the application's dependencies
5. Then wait until all the resources (like 30) have been fetched from PokeAPI

Yeah, I know, that sucks. But hey, that's why I'm learning.

Thanks to The Pokémon Company, Nintendo, GameFreak, the team that mantains PokeAPI, smogon for the images, and Nolan Lawson and his awesome project pokedex.org, which is an inspiration for this one
